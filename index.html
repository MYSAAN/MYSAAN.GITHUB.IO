<p>RAMADAN MUBARIK</p>

<p>This year Ramadan started on the 18th of June. As usually we had time off school to celebrate the month of Ramadan with family and friends.</p>
<p>This ramadan I have seen many students from this school sitting in the mousque  resiting quran which made me feel very happy. Also I have seen the mousque full of people which is a very rare sight in this island. </p></td>
